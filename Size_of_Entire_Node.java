Yes, the size of the entire blockchain can be quite large in terms of storage size, especially for well-established blockchain networks like Bitcoin. The blockchain is a continuously growing ledger that records all transactions ever made on the network. As new transactions are added and blocks are mined, the blockchain increases in size over time.

For example, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the Bitcoin blockchain had reached several hundred gigabytes in size. This size is due to the accumulation of transaction data, block headers, and other metadata associated with each block.

It's important to note that the storage requirements can vary between different blockchain networks based on factors such as block size, block interval, and the number of transactions being processed. Smaller, less-active blockchains might have smaller storage requirements, while larger and more active networks could have much larger storage demands.

Managing the storage requirements of running a full node is a consideration for participants in blockchain networks. Some networks provide ways to run "light" nodes that don't require storing the entire blockchain but rely on trusted third parties for certain information. However, running a full node provides the highest level of security and trust in the network's operations.
